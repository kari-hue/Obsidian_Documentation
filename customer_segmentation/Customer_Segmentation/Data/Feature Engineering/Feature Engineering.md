  
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful and useful features that can be used by machine learning algorithms to improve the model's predictive performance. It involves creating, modifying, or selecting input variables (features) that enhance the algorithm's ability to understand patterns in the data.

For a better customer profiling we will be engineering some features. 
Here, I am doing two different types of feature engineering.

1. [[RFM - Engineering]]
2. [[Feature Engineering after behavioral analysis]]
