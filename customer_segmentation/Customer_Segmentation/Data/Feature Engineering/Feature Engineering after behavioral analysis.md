I created new features after doing some behavioral analysis on the available dataset.

Questions to ask?

- How many unique products are purchased by the consumers ?(This helps us to better understand the buying taste of the consumer. A higher value indicates that the consumer has a diverse taste and lower value means that the user doesn't have wide variety of taste when it comes to the product purchase). This can further help us segment the users in the basis of their buying diversity also.
    
- What is the average days between purchase of the consumers?? What is the favorite shopping day? what is the most likely time for the user to shop(Representing the busiest time)??

-  Using the country column to do region based analysis

-  Analyzing the mean of monthly spending, standard deviation of spending and spending trend overall calculated using a linear slope.

We came up with the new data set after the analysis and feature engineering and they are:
