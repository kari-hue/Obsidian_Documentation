In this section, I am going to analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand the distinct behaviors and preferences of different customer segments and also profile each cluster to identify the key traits that define the customers in each cluster.

One of the important things that I am going to do is use a Radar Chart Approach

- Here I will be creating radar charts to visualize the centroid values of each cluster across different clusters. To construct the radar charts, it's essential to first compute the centroid for each cluster. This centroid represents the mean value for all features within a specific cluster. Subsequently, I will display these centroids on the radar charts, facilitating a clear visualization of the central tendencies of each feature across the various clusters.

### Results

### Inference
We can infer and bring out some conclusions about the clusters:

1. Cluster 0: From the observation, we can see that the customer belonging to this cluster

- Tend to do hourly shopping(active during some hours of the time), frequent buyers
- They are low-spenders but buy diverse products and their purchase pattern is also frequent. -impulse buyers

We can quote them as "Hourly buying customers" - Push low value fast moving products to lure these customers, increase flash sales or some hourly sale campaign and target these customers

2. Cluster 1: The customer belonging to this cluster

- Are the high spenders, in-frequent buyers, buy diverse products and also have a lot of cancellation We can address them as Infrequent high spending buyers - try to reduce cancellations, quality control of the products sold, reminder notification to make them come back sooner in the platform

1. Cluster 3: The customers belonging to this cluster

- Are the low-spending customers, the least active ones We can address them as almost churning customers - Throw reminder notifications on a daily basis, alluring discounts, pushing variety low value products
