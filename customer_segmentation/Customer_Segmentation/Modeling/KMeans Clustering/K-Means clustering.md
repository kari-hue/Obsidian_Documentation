 K means clustering  is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into k-distinct groups(clusters) based on feature similarity. It is widely used in clustering problems to group data points that are more similar to each other than to the points to other group.

Following the steps:

Step by step working of k-means clustering:

1. Choose the number of clusters(k= ?) - we will apply famous [[Elbow Method]] to find the optimal number of cluster for our dataset.
2. Initialize cluster center(This is also randomized)
3. Assign data points to the cluster and set up the centroids again
4. Repeat the process until the convergence of the centroids or the centroids could be changed no longer [[Implementation]]
5. Then [[Visualization and Evaluation]] of the model for it's performance
6. [[Profiling and Refinement]] of the model further
