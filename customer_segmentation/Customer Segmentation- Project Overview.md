In this project, we will invest ourself in the thriving sector of **online retail** by analyzing a dataset that is based on transaction taken form a UK-based retailer. The dataset is present in [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). The dataset is a bit old comprising the data from the year 2010 and 2011.However, the data that has been collected is still relevant for our project as the data scenario in the retail sector hasn't changed much. The primary objective of the project is to amplify the efficiency of marketing strategies and boost sales through **Customer Segmentation**.For this purpose we will be using the concept of **K-Means Clustering** algorithm.

**K-means clustering:** K-means clustering is a method used to group data points into clusters, or groups, based on their similarity. Here’s a simple breakdown:

Start with a Goal: You decide how many clusters (groups) you want to create (e.g., 3 clusters for customer types: budget, moderate, and luxury).

Place Initial Centers: K-means randomly picks points to act as the "center" of each cluster.

Assign Data Points to Centers: Each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster center, grouping similar points together.

Update Centers: After all points are assigned, K-means calculates the average (center) of each group and moves the cluster centers there.

Repeat: Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the cluster centers stop moving, meaning the groups are stable.

After clustering the project intend to develop a **recommendation system** that will suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet, ultimately enhancing marketing efficacy and fostering increased sales.
